Hi, I’m Ishika. I’ve always been someone who loves figuring out how things work, especially when it comes to technology. Over time, that curiosity grew into a real interest in building projects—websites, apps, and anything that allows me to bring an idea to life. I’ve been learning and working with tools like React, Node.js, Firebase, and MongoDB, which have given me the foundation to build full-stack applications. One project I’m especially proud of is a storybook generator that uses AI to create personalized stories for kids. It started as a simple idea and became something that blends creativity with code, which I really enjoy. Along the way, I’ve gotten more comfortable with Postman for API testing, Figma for UI/UX design, and GitHub for version control. I like keeping my work clean, organized, and meaningful. I recently started exploring more advanced things like authentication, custom backends, and cloud services like Azure. It’s a lot to learn, but that’s part of what excites me. I genuinely enjoy sitting with a problem, breaking it down, and solving it step by step—even if it means going through errors and rethinking everything. Outside of coding, I try to balance things out. I go to the gym regularly and make an effort to stay fit and active. It helps me stay focused, motivated, and mentally fresh. I’ve learned that even when things get frustrating—whether in debugging or life—discipline and patience go a long way. I also enjoy helping others when I can. If someone’s stuck on a problem I’ve faced before, I’m always willing to walk them through it. I believe learning is a shared journey, and explaining something to someone else often helps me understand it better too. I’m still figuring out where exactly I want to take my skills, but I know I want to keep building things that matter. Whether that’s in education, AI, storytelling, or something else, I’m excited to keep exploring. I’ve come to enjoy the process of starting from a blank file and slowly watching something take shape—sometimes through trial and error, sometimes through inspiration. I don’t think I need to know everything right now. What matters to me is consistency, curiosity, and staying open to learning. Even when I mess up a folder with rm -r or push to the wrong remote (yes, I’ve done that), I just take a breath, figure it out, and move forward. Every mistake teaches me something, and I try not to let fear of doing it wrong stop me from trying. I also like personal projects that feel fun or meaningful, not just assignments or tutorials. I’m interested in using AI in ways that are useful but also thoughtful—like turning leftovers into recipes, or translating words across languages. These ideas may sound small, but I believe they can make people’s lives better, and that’s what drives me. I also like making sure things don’t just work but feel good to use. That’s where my love for Figma comes in—making interfaces that are simple, clean, and easy to understand. I’m learning to think not just like a developer, but like a user. I want people to enjoy what I build, not just tolerate it. I also try to keep track of everything I do so I can come back to it, improve it, and maybe even share it with others. Sometimes I’m just experimenting with components. Other times, I’m deep in async/await or structuring a backend flow. And yes, there are days when nothing seems to work—but I remind myself that every developer goes through that. What matters is showing up again tomorrow. I’ve learned to ask better questions, use better tools, and even write better commit messages. The more I build, the more I realize how much I still want to learn—and I find that exciting. I’m not rushing it. I’m okay being in the process. I want to build things I can be proud of, and also stay humble enough to improve. I know that growth isn’t always linear. Sometimes, you hit a wall, or feel stuck, but eventually, you break through. That’s the best feeling. I want to stay grounded, stay learning, and stay building. That’s where I’m at—and I’m excited to see where it goes.
